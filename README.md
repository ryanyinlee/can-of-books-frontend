Create an app that tracks what books have impacted users and to recommend what to read next.

*"Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next."*

# Team Agreement.

## Logistical

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

Ryan: 9AM-11:59PM PST
Matt: 9AM-11PM PST

**What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

Slack

**How often will you take breaks?**

Every hour or so can take 5-10 minutes. Lunch at 12 and dinner around 6AM.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

Try to get the lab done every day, but if we find a blocker get help from a TA or instructor using the 15 min rule.

## Cooperative

**Make a list of each person’s strengths.**

Matt: Front end, keeping schedule, keeping us accountable. 
Ryan: Research, reading.

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**

Matt: Schedule is very important for projects with time management.
Ryan: Research and reading can help us figure out some issues or technologies.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**

Matt: Want more familiarity with the backend, REST/CRUD
Ryan: Also want more familiarity with backend and database since we're just learning it.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**

Start each lab time going over where we are, where we need to go and then spending the lab time working together so we can both understand our current positions by end of lab.


## Conflict Resolution


**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**

Communication is important to let the other person know that they aren't contributing - if for some reason they don't want to work it out, we will find a third party to arbitrate.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**

Communication is important to let the other person know that they are contributing too much - if for some reason they don't want to work it out, we will find a third party to arbitrate.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

Try to empathize and consider psychological safety. Find help when necessary.
